# When Do I Want To Convert a Decimal to a String With Guaranteed Two Decimal Places and Accurate Rounding?<br>I Want To Convert a Decimal to a String With Guaranteed Two Decimal Places and Accurate Rounding Now!

I was struggling with keeping all the possible cases in mind when making the function (e.g. when to pad a zero at the end, pad a zero in the tenths place, etc.)
So I decided to go test-driven on this function.
Since I wrote a unit test, I might as well put this up here.

If in the off chance you happen to go through my code, and for some really odd reason, decide to check my work, let me know if I screwed up! :D
